Here are a few sentences to serve as an example of some apparent misspelled words. Many 
students are grateful for autocorrect which helps to fix common spelling errors such as medieval 
or separate. Especially when taking Humanities class, certain words spelled in medieval literature are weird, 
because it is especially apparent that these words are misspelled. Some words are even combined 
into a new word when they are supposed to have been kept separate from each 
other. For the ease and convenience of correct spell-checking which auto-correct provides, I am really 
grateful.
