Here are a few sentences to serve as an example of some apparant misspelled words. Many students are greatful for autocorrect
which helps to fix common spelling errors such as medievel or seperate. Especially when taking Humanities class, certain words
spelled in medieval literature are wierd, because it is especially apparant that these words are misspelled. Some words are even
combined into a new word when they are supposed to have been kept separate from each other. For the ease and convenience of correct
spell-checking which auto-correct provides, I am really greatful.
