How to covert user input to all lowercase...

in C# use .ToLower() at the end of user input.


Example...

string answer;
WriteLine("type 'yes' to continue...");
answer = ReadLine().ToLower();

...now even if the user types 'YES' it should be stored as 'yes'.



C++ program implementation...
*HAVE to use "#include <algorithm>" to work...

string answerKey;
cout << "Enter your name: ";
cin >> name;
std::transform(name.begin(), name.end(), name.begin(), ::tolower);
cout << "Your name is " << name << endl;

Potential C++ implementation...
Look into possibly evaluating char types instead of (or in addition to) transforming string types...
